# Swift Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains implementation of various data structures and algorithms in the Swift programming language. The goal is to practice and provide a comprehensive understanding of these concepts and their implementation in Swift.

## Content
- Complexities (Big O notation)
- Linked List
- Stack Data Structure
- Queues
- Recursion
- Trees
- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees
- Binary Search
- Sorting algorithms
- Graphs

## Work in Progress
This project is a work in progress, and new data structures and algorithms will be added over time.

## Todo
- Add more sorting algorithms
- Implement Hash Tables
- Implement Dynamic Programming algorithms
- Add more examples and explanations to enhance understanding of the concepts

## Note
The repository is for educational and reference purposes only.
